Current state:
fil.algorithm.CR is official (update linkmapping), now its acceptance rate
is competitive with Full Remapping

Future works:

1. "benchmark" method in Topology may yield bad result after 
changing unassigned VNF's resource consumption values in migration test-bed

2. ML model is out-of-date, need a new one

3. After having new ML models, please reconsider CR power (currently it's
much higher than REAP) 

4. If REAP receives new LinkMapping like CR, then its acceptance rate is
also competitive
