# Instruction  
Quick instruction for the event-based edge-cloud simulator  

## Notice  
New simulation is recommended to use to [Python-based version](https://github.com/future-internet-lab/edgecloud-simulator)
Reproduction of the paper ... can be done with the Java version. Please use the **Maven project** to automatically install all the dependencies.

## Dataset for prediction model  
The dataset of traffic from `Nistelrodeseweg road, Netherlands, 2018` can be found in [Traffic-model/2018-weekdays-quarter.csv](https://github.com/future-internet-lab/edgecloud-simulator/blob/Java/Traffic-model/2018-weekdays-quarter.csv). Both `csv` and `excel` files represent the same dataset.  
The overview of the traffic:

The system metric dataset based on the traffic dataset can be found in [/ML-data-models-2022](https://github.com/future-internet-lab/edgecloud-simulator/tree/Java/ML-data-models-2022) under file name `24h-05`, `24h-10` and `24h-20`, which represent the dataset recorded in `30 mins timewindow`, `1h timewindow` and `2h timewindow`, each.
